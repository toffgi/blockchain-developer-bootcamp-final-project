I would like to build an NFT Marketplace, where artist can create and sell NFTs.

1. Visitors will have to register themselves somehow on the contract.
2. The restered users should submit digital assets that represent their work. 
3. They can build entire collections and sell those pieces at a specific price or set up a bidding system so that those who offer the highest price will get the desired item. 
4. Once the non-fungible tokens are created, customers will see them available for sales/bidding. 
5. Customers pick the desired cryptocurrency for deals (among the ones supported).
6. Both sides obtain notifications once the goods are sold. Finally, the service controls all transactions and movements of items.
